<h2>1. Turkopticon, people, and background</h2>

<h3><a name="1.1"></a>1.1. What is Turkopticon?</h3>

<p>
  Turkopticon used to be a volunteer run software project and now it is a worker-run 
  organizing and advocacy project, and software is one of the things we do.
</p>

<h3><a name="1.2"></a>1.2. Why should Turkers have a voice?</h3>
<p>
  Have you ever had an issue with an Mturk requester? If you have, then you know 
  that some experiences are not ideal and leaving a review is not enough. We know 
  one voice alone doesn’t usually make a difference. When we unite those voices, 
  the squeaky wheel gets the oil. This is where Turkopticon comes in and why we need 
  to build the voices for Turkers. We need to stand up and acknowledge the issues 
  and work together to make Mturk better for us all. 
</p>
<p>
  There is lots Turkers don’t agree on. But there’s one thing we do agree on. MTurk 
  could be better. That’s why we all need to be in the room. We need your voice to 
  show that Turkers do care and your unique experience needs to be heard by other Turkers. 
  With unique voices, we can find ways of making Turk better that truly help us all. 
</p>

<h3><a name="1.3"></a>1.3. Who organizes Turkopticon?</h3>
<p>
  The committee is made up of Alex, Ashley, Brook, Krystal, 
  Clearblue, Phil, Sherry, with other dedicated Turk workers.
</p>
<p>
  Turkopticon is maintained by the committee and volunteers from Tech Workers Coalition.
</p>
<p>
  Turkopticon was founded by <a href="http://quote.ucsd.edu/lirani/" target="_blank">Lilly Irani 
  </a>and <a href="http://wtf.tw/" target="_blank">Six Silberman</a> when they were kids. Lilly is now a 
  professor at the University of California, San Diego. Six is an engineer based in London.
</p>

<h3><a name="1.4"></a>1.4. Who has been involved with Turkopticon in the past?</h3>
<p>
  Turkopticon was founded by students at a university, <a href="http://quote.ucsd.edu/lirani/" target="_blank">Lilly Irani</a> 
  and <a href="http://wtf.tw/" target="_blank">Six Silberman</a>. 
  Lilly and Six had worked as programmers and wanted to support Turkers in finding better work. 
  Along the way they got help from Turkers, from people who worked with crowdsourcing, students, 
  and from moderators who were Turkers and the daily lifeblood of the community.

</p>

<h3><a name="1.5"></a>1.5. Is Turkopticon associated with Amazon?</h3>
<p>No. It is not and it has never been.</p>

<h3><a name="1.6"></a>1.6. Why was Turkopticon built?</h3>
<p>
  Turkopticon started in 2008 as a class project to raise awareness about the 
  unaccountability of Mechanical Turk requesters. We saw requesters and researchers 
  celebrating how cheaply they could get work done on Mechanical Turk and we felt this 
  was wrong. We didn't understand why Amazon didn't build in a requester reputation system, 
  like Amazon Marketplace and eBay have. Building Turkopticon was our way of making this 
  point. We never expected it to be used by so many people, or to become a fixture in 
  the Turker community.
</p>

<h3><a name="1.7"></a>1.7. Can I give a donation?</h3>
<p>
  Yes! This will ensure that we can continue to provide a worker run review site 
  where we focus on the human part of reviews.  Turkers and requesters understand 
  how to make things better.
</p>
<p>
  You can donate to the project at <a href="https://blog.turkopticon.info/?page_id=758">this link</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you cannot make a monetary donation we are always looking for volunteers to 
  make Turk better for us all.  If you are interested in building a voice for Turkers, 
  please contact us at <a href="volunteers@turkopticon.net">volunteers@turkopticon.net</a>. 
</p>

<h2>2. Reviews, flags, and comments</h2>

<h3><a name="2.1"></a>2.1. How can I get the Turkopticon Script?</h3>

<p>
  In order to run the script, you will need a userscript manager such as 
  <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/" target="_blank">Tampermonkey</a> or 
  <a href="https://www.greasespot.net/" target="_blank">Greasemonkey</a>
</p>
<p>
  Once you have a userscript manager, you can grab the latest version of the 
  <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/431111-turkopticon-net" target="blank">
    turkopticon userscript here
  </a><>
</p>

<h3><a name="2.2"></a>2.2. What are the requester "attributes" ("comm", "pay", "fair", and "fast")?</h3>

<p><b>Note: </b>The <b>generosity </b>attribute is being replaced by <b>pay/hr</b>.</p>
<p>The "attributes" used to describe requesters answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>communicativity</strong> ("comm"): How responsive has this requester been to communications or concerns you have raised?</li>
  <li><strong>generosity</strong> ("pay"): How well has this requester paid for the amount of time their HITs take?</li>
  <li><strong>fairness</strong> ("fair"): How fair has this requester been in approving or rejecting your work?</li>
  <li><strong>promptness</strong> ("fast"): How promptly has this requester approved your work and paid?</li>
</ul>

<p>We have added a <b>pay/hr </b>attribute in place of the 1-5 scale rating for pay/generosity. The 1-5 rating system doesn't take into account workers being spread across the globe and other various influences that affect judgement of pay. We hope this will help workers better determine hits they want to do, and remove the frustration some workers were experiencing with the pay ratings in the past.</p>


<h3><a name="2.3"></a>2.3. How do I post a review?</h3>

<img src="review_link_2021.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="Review link in add-on drop-down" />

<p>The easiest way to post a review is to click the link "Report your experience with this requester" in the add-on drop-down.</p>

<p>However, you can also review any requester by going to <a href="https://turkopticon.net/report">turkopticon.ucsd.edu/report</a> (Turkopticon login required). You'll need to know their Mechanical Turk requester ID, though (e.g., A1BC2DE34FGHJ5). If you don't include a Mechanical Turk requester ID, your ratings won't be included in the average ratings shown by the add-on.</p>



<h3><a name="2.4"></a>2.4. I am not getting the verification email.</h3>

<p>This is probably because of a problem with our mail sending system. Fixing this is on our list of things to do. In the meantime, email us at <a href="mailto:moderation@turkopticon.net">moderation@turkopticon.net</a> from the email address associated with your Turkopticon account and we'll verify it manually.</p>



<h3><a name="2.5"></a>2.5. How can I write a good review?</h3>

<p>Give the ratings you feel best describe your experience.</p>

<p>You may wish to put the name(s) of the HIT(s) you are reviewing in the "HIT Name(s)" field.</p>

<p>If one of the fields is not relevant, leave it blank.</p>

<p>For example, if you didn't need to communicate with the requester, leave that field blank.</p>

<p>Don't include or link to profanity, racial slurs, or ethnic slurs.</p>

<p>Don't personally insult or attack requesters or other workers. Calling a requester "cheap" is okay, but anything stronger is subject to being hidden.</p>

<p>Don't include personal information about the requester unless it is part of the HIT.</p>

<p>Don't write your review in ALL CAPS.</p>

<p>Don't include screening information, information about attention checks, or completion codes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you're a requester, don't review yourself. Comment instead.</p>

<p>Reviews that are profane or insulting or appear to be requester self-reviews may be hidden.</p>

<p>The most up-to-date version of these guidelines will always be posted on the <a href="http://turkopticon.ucsd.edu/report">review page</a> (Turkopticon login required).</p>



<h3><a name="2.6"></a>2.6. Can I delete my review?</h3>

<p>For now, no.</p>

<p>If you managed to post a review of the same requester twice (i.e., there was a technical error), <a href="mailto:moderation@turkopticon.net">email us</a> and we will delete the duplicate, as long as nobody else has flagged or commented on it yet.</p>

<p>The main reason we don't allow deletion of reviews is accountability. The world around Mechanical Turk, including Turkopticon, is generally one of mistrust and suspicion. If we allowed untraceable deletion of reviews, people might worry that we were deleting reviews at the request of requesters. We don't do that, and we don't want to jeopardize the usefulness of Turkopticon by giving anyone any reason to imagine that we might. So we don't delete any reviews, even at the request of the author. (Duplicates are the only exception.)</p>

<p>A second reason is that if we were to delete a review that had comments or flags on it, those comments or flags would disappear. This could be confusing, and confusion causes frustration and suspicion, which we try to avoid.</p>

<p>Sometimes people post a review they later regret posting. This often happens when other people flag the review or leave mean comments. The review author often wants to delete the review in order to delete the comments or flags. In our view this is unfair to the comment authors or flaggers, even if they said mean things. We do not have a policy of censoring something if it is merely mean&mdash;only if it is profane. In the long run, usually the person who said the mean thing is more embarrassed than the person they said it to. If you are in this situation, you can always edit your review!</p>

<p>All that said, in the future, we may allow review authors to delete their own reviews. If we do this, we will find a way to keep a record that the review existed, and keep comments and flags accessible. For now, if you have the urge to delete a review you posted, the best thing to do is edit it instead, or leave a comment under it.</p>



<h3><a name="2.7"></a>2.7. What is a comment and how can I post one?</h3>

<img src="comment.png" alt="Comment" />

<p>A comment is a piece of text that responds to a review. (See figure at right.) You post a comment "on" a review.</p>

<p>New Turkopticon accounts cannot post comments. Once you have posted some reviews, you can <a href="https://turkopticon.net/main/request_commenting">request commenting</a> (Turkopticon login required) by clicking on the previous link or on the link that says "request commenting ability" that appears between the "settings" and "logout" links at the top of every Turkopticon page while you are logged in.</p>

<p>Commenting requests are reviewed manually, usually within a few days, by our administrators. If you have only posted a few reviews, please expect to be told that you will need to wait to be able to comment.</p>

<p>If you are a requester and you want to post comments in reply to reviews, please <a href="mailto:moderation@turkopticon.net">email us</a>.</p>



<h3><a name="2.8"></a>2.8. I asked for commenting over a week ago, but I still can't comment and I haven't heard back.</h3>

<p>If your comments and/or reviews have been the subject of heated community discussion in the past (for example, you have been involved in flame wars with other people on the site, or have repeatedly posted comments that were hidden for profanity or racism), your commenting request may have been ignored.</p>

<!-- TO DO -->



<h3><a name="2.9"></a>2.9. Can I delete my comment?</h3>

<p>For now, no. You can edit it, though.</p>



<h3><a name="2.10"></a>2.10. What is a flag and how can I post one?</h3>

<p>A flag is a sign for moderators to consider hiding a review that may violate Turkopticon's civility guidelines (see above, <a href="#2.5">Section 1.5, "How can I write a good review?"</a>). If a moderator agrees that the review violates civility guidelines or is otherwise inappropriate, the moderator will also flag the review. If a review has at least two flags, and at least one is from a moderator, the review is hidden. Ratings from hidden reviews are not included in the average ratings shown by the add-on.</p>

<p>Only people who can comment can flag reviews. (See above, <a href="#2.7">Section 2.7, "What is a comment and how can I post one?"</a> for information on commenting and getting access to commenting.)</p>

<p>Also, if a <em>comment</em> on a review violates civility guidelines, please don't flag the review. Post to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/turkopticon-discuss">turkopticon-discuss</a> instead.</p>



<h3><a name="2.11"></a>2.11. Can I delete my flag?</h3>

<p>For now, no. You can edit it or convert it to a comment, though.</p>



<h3><a name="2.12"></a>2.12. What are appropriate uses of flags and comments?</h3>

<p>Flag a review if it:</p>

<ul>
<li>contains profanity, racism, threats, incitements to violence, or harassment or incitement to harassment (e.g., "here is this requester's personal phone number, call them and tell them what you think")</li>
<li>directly insults a worker or requester</li>
<li>incorrectly claims that the requester has violated the Mechanical Turk Terms of Service</li>
<li>may have been written by the requester or on behalf of the requester</li>
<li>is otherwise suspicious</li>
<li>is misplaced or irrelevant, or</li>
<li>should be looked at by a moderator for some other reason</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, flags are for reviews that violate our civility guidelines or threaten the integrity of the review database. <strong>If you simply disagree with a reviewer, but believe they are reviewing with good intent, <em>even if you think they are reviewing "wrongly"</em>, comment instead.</strong> Flags, generally, are for reviews which appear to have some sort of malicious intent.</p>

<p>Moderators and administrators may ignore flags at their discretion. </p>

<p>If you're not sure if you should flag or comment, comment.</p>

<p>As in reviewing (see above, <a href="#2.5">Section 2.5, How can I write a good review?</a>), when commenting, please:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't include or link to profanity, racial slurs, or ethnic slurs.</li>
<li>Don't personally insult or attack requesters or other workers.</li>
<li>Don't include personal information about the requester unless it is part of the HIT.</li>
<li>Don't write in ALL CAPS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Comments violating these guidelines <strong>may</strong> be edited by administrators or moderators.</p>



<h3><a name="2.13"></a>2.13. I am a requester. Can you delete or censor a review of me?</h3>

<p>Delete? No. (See above, <a href="#2.6">Section 2.6, "Can I delete my review?"</a>)</p>

<p>Censor? Probably not.</p>

<p>With the exception of technical errors (e.g., a review posted twice), we do not delete reviews, even at the request of the author.</p>

<p>In general, requesters are encouraged to comment on reviews rather than flag. But if a review clearly falls within the flagging guidelines (see above, <a href="#2.12">Section 2.12, "What are appropriate uses of flags and comments?"</a>), feel free to flag it. If a moderator agrees that the review violates Turkopticon's civility guidelines (see above, <a href="#2.5">Section 2.5, "How can I write a good review?"</a>), they will also flag it, and the review will be hidden. The ratings included in hidden reviews are not included in the averages displayed by the add-on. (For more on flagging, see above, Sections 2.10&ndash;2.12.)</p>

<b>Personal information about requesters:</b>
<p>
  If personal information about a requester is available in the HIT 
  (for example in a consent form workers must read before doing a HIT as part of an academic study), 
  we allow that information to be posted in a review.
</p>

<p>
  We reserve the right to remove or censor other personal information, but we do 
  not guarantee that we will do so, even at the requester's request.
</p>


<h2>3. Miscellaneous technical issues</h2>

<h3><a name="3.1"></a>3.1. My display name is based on my email address (e.g., s...@g...). How do I change it?</h3>

<p>In general, once your display name is set, it is supposed to stay as it is. But if there was a mistake and somehow your display name was set to the default display name (which is based on the email address you used to sign up for Turkopticon), <a href="mailto:moderation@turkopticon.net">email us</a> and we will "unset" it, after which you can pick a different display name.</p>

<p>If you already have a "real" display name, we will not unset it. The point of this is to create a little bit of accountability.</p>



<h3><a name="3.2"></a>3.2. Can I delete my account?</h3>

<p>For now, the best we can do is "close" your account.</p>

<p>
  We realize this can be frustrating. "I own all of my reviews!", you might say, 
  "I have a right to delete them!" In principle, we agree. Unfortunately there 
  are technical issues. The main one is that if we actually <em>deleted</em> your 
  account&mdash;deleted the entry in the Turkopticon database that represents your 
  account&mdash;we would have a bunch of reviews left over associated with a 
  nonexistent account. When the web site tried to display those reviews, it would 
  choke. "So delete them!", you might say. If nobody else had commented on or flagged 
  <em>any</em> of your reviews, we could do that without any technical 
  issues&mdash;although we would still have the accountability issues discussed 
  in Section 2.6, "Can I delete my review?". But this is not usually the case. 
  And if we delete a review that someone else has commented on, we are effectively 
  disappearing their comment, which is not fair to them (see above, Section 2.6, 
  "Can I delete my review?", for more on this topic).
</p>

<p>
  So, for now, the best we can do is "close" your account. A closed account cannot 
  be logged into. In the future it is possible we will hide reviews from closed 
  accounts in the same way we hide reviews that violate civility guidelines, although 
  for the moment we see no real need to do this.
</p>

<p>As of 5 August 2013, we have not closed many accounts (in fact we have closed exactly one), so our policy on this topic is not very well developed. We don't understand fully why people are motivated to delete their accounts, so we don't know exactly what else we should do when an account is closed. We are open to discussing ways to improve how we handle it.</p>

<p>To close your account, <a href="mailto:moderation@turkopticon.net">email us</a>. In the future, we may set up a way to do it automatically.</p>



<h3><a name="3.3"></a>3.3. Does Turkopticon collect personalized data about me?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<p>A version of Turkopticon posted in 2010&ndash;2011 did collect anonymized data automatically. This code was written by an economist who wanted to make actual wage data available to Turkers, but it was removed because of privacy concerns.</p>



<h3><a name="3.4"></a>3.4. I am a requester and I changed my name on Mechanical Turk. Can you change my name on Turkopticon?</h3>

<p>Yes. <a href="mailto:moderation@turkopticon.net">Email us</a>.</p>



<h2>4. The Turkopticon application programming interface (API)</h2>

<h3><a name="4.1"></a>4.1. What is the Turkopticon API?</h3>

<p>The Turkopticon API is a PHP file that accepts Mechanical Turk requester IDs and returns the information about those requesters available in the Turkopticon database. Specifically, for each requester ID, it returns the requester's name, average ratings for the four requester attributes ("comm", "pay" (this may be zero for new requesters with reviews in lieu of the pay/hr), "fair", and "fast"; see <a href="#2.2">Section 2.2, "What are the requester 'attributes'?"</a>), pay/hr ("pay_bucket"), the number of reviews for the requester in the Turkopticon database (excluding hidden reviews), and the number of those reviews that reported that the requester violated the Mechanical Turk Terms of Service.</p>

<p>This information is returned as a JSON object [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">wikipedia entry</a>; <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-13">example JSON object</a>; <a href="https://turkopticon.net/api/multi-attrs.php?ids=A3VTXG9MRA65HP">example from Turkopticon API</a>].</p>



<h3><a name="4.2"></a>4.2. Why does it exist?</h3>

<p>It is used by the Turkopticon user script and browser add-ons to quickly retrieve data about requesters from the Turkopticon database.</p>



<h3><a name="4.3"></a>4.3. How do I use it?</h3>

<p>Call</p>

<blockquote><code>https://turkopticon.net/api/multi-attrs.php?ids=foo,bar,baz,bat</code></blockquote>

<p>where <code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, <code>baz</code>, and <code>bat</code> are the Mechanical Turk IDs of the requesters you want information for. For example, calling</p>

<blockquote><code>https://turkopticon.net/api/multi-attrs.php?ids=A35VLPB12A0TTY,A3VTXG9MRA65HP,A3OO8KUVWDSZPV</code></blockquote>

<p>returns information about the requesters <code>IMP AMT</code> and <code>rohzit0d</code>, and <code>CrowdSource</code>.</p>

<p>You may pass as many IDs as you like to <code>multi-attrs.php</code>. It has not been tested with more than a hundred or so, however. Calls with hundreds of IDs or more may be slow, or fail entirely.</p>



<h3><a name="4.4"></a>4.4. Do I need permission to use it?</h3>

<p>No. However, if you plan to use it on an ongoing basis, please also <a href="mailto:info@turkopticon.info">tell us</a>, so we can warn you if we plan to make any changes that may break your application. Also, if you use it a lot over a short period of time, the server may crash. This will make your application fail and cause problems for other users. Please <a href="mailto:info@turkopticon.info">ask us</a> before doing this so we can keep an eye on server load.</p>


<h3><a name="4.5"></a>4.5. Are there any rate limits to the API?</h3>

<p>Yes. If you call the API more than once a second, you will receive an error message.</p>


<h3><a name="4.6"></a>4.6. Can I see the code?</h3>

<p>Yes. It is on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/fiveplusone/turkopticon-php-api">here</a>. It is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt">GNU Affero General Public License</a>.</p>



<a name="5.0"><h2>5. Known issues and future plans</h2></a>
<p>The software team has been recently reinvigorated with fresh volunteers, and the team is working on improving Turkopticon, both with features and under the hood.</p>


<h2>6. Privacy</h2>

<h3><a name="6.1"></a>6.1. I am a requester. A reviewer posted an email I sent them in a review. Can you remove it?</h3>

<p>Almost certainly no.</p>

<p>
  While you may feel that emails you send to workers are implicitly private, such 
  emails are in our view not 'personal communication' but 'business communication'. 
  While requesters are not employers in the legal sense, requesters are in a position 
  of power over workers by virtue of making payment decisions that may have significant 
  practical consequences. Therefore if a worker feels threatened, intimidated, condescended 
  to, or even just frustrated by an email sent by a requester, we feel it is reasonable 
  for them to be able to post it publicly in a place where other workers or potential 
  workers can see it. We may not always agree that it is a good idea for a worker to do so, 
  but in general we will not censor reviews or comments that include emails sent to 
  workers by requesters.
</p>

<p>There are three main exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a review directly insults a requester (or other workers), it is subject to being hidden.</li>
<li>
  If a review or comment includes <strong>personal</strong> contact information 
  for a requester not available via the HIT, we <strong>may</strong> choose to 
  censor it, although we do not guarantee that we will, even on request.
</li>
<li>
  Finally, if a review or comment encourages other workers to harass a requester, 
  we may choose to censor it. (Please note that encouraging harassment is different 
  from encouraging others to file a formal complaint with a supervisor or 
  institutional review board.)
</li>
</ul>



<h2>7. Information for researchers</h2>

<h3><a name="7.1"></a>7.1. I am a researcher. Can I use average requester data from Turkopticon?</h3>

<p>Yes. You may use the publicly-accessible Turkopticon API (see above, Section 3).</p>

<p>
  If you publish or present anything using this data, or if you discover something 
  interesting about it that we might not know, please 
  <a href="mailto:info@turkopticon.info">tell us</a>!
</p>

<p>
  If you plan to use the API on an ongoing basis, please also 
  <a href="mailto:info@turkopticon.info">tell us</a>, so we can warn you if we 
  plan to make any changes that may break your application.
</p>



<h3><a name="7.2"></a>7.2. I am a researcher. Can you give me anonymized data from the Turkopticon database?</h3>

<p>
  We have not done this so far, although we might be willing to consider it. We 
  would consult publicly with workers first, so if you want to make a request like 
  this, please ask well in advance of any deadlines you may have.
</p>



<h3><a name="7.3"></a>7.3. I am a researcher. Can I run a field experiment on Turkopticon?</h3>

<p>
  We recommend strongly that you do not do this, even if you think you can do it 
  undetected. A previous field experiment that we were unaware of was discovered 
  by workers while in progress and resulted in formal IRB complaints to the 
  researchers' home institution and severe stress and large amounts of lost time, 
  money, sleep, and effort for the researchers.
</p>

<p>
  While Turkopticon was built by, and continues to be operated partly by, 
  researchers, we do not use Turkopticon data to produce research. We have 
  published papers <strong>about</strong> Turkopticon, but we do not publish papers 
  using Turkopticon data. Use of Turkopticon is <strong>not</strong> implicit 
  consent to being a research subject. Turkopticon's primary research contribution 
  is to help imagine more responsible approaches to the design and operation of 
  computing systems. Thus Turkopticon's first responsibility is to the community of 
  workers that relies on it.
