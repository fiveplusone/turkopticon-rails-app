          After careful consideration we've decided to temporarily implement pay brackets in place of the current 1-5 scale rating for pay. The current rating system doesn't take into account workers being spread across the globe and other various influences that affect judgement of pay. We hope this will help workers better determine hits they want to do, and remove the frustration some workers were experiencing with the pay ratings in the past.
